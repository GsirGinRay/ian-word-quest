But when Amy came home from school, the cookies were GONE!\n\n\"Who took my cookies?\" Mom asked.\n\nAmy looked around. She saw brown crumbs on the floor. The crumbs made a trail. Amy followed the trail... to the dog's bed!\n\nThere was Max, the family dog. He had chocolate on his nose!\n\n\"I found the cookie thief!\" Amy laughed. \"It's Max!\"\n\nMom said, \"Good job, Detective Amy. But Max can't eat chocolate. It's bad for dogs!\"\n\nAmy learned something new: chocolate is dangerous for dogs. She gave Max a dog treat instead.",
